When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to be able to access my file anywhere without my computer.  Also, when I want to have others to collaborate with me on the project. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might not want to publish my changes I made in the local computer. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is to copy other people's repository to your own git hub, then you can clone it to your local computer. 
Clone is to copy other people's repository to your local computer
Branch is to build an alternative route from the main project, and it does not impact the main project's performance.
