When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to be able to access my file anywhere without my computer.  Also, when I want to have others to collaborate with me on the project. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might not want to publish my changes I made in the local computer.
